# Spencer-Portfolio


My name is Spencer and I'm currently attending Ivy Tech for a TC in IT Support. I like to watch movies, read, hangout with my girlfriend, spend time in nature, and play video games. I currently dont't have any degrees at the moment but I hope that will change with Ivy Tech. I have a little bit of IT knowledge from studying for the Comptia A+ certification which I have completed one of the two tests that make up the entire certification as well as some experience and skills I learned from doing a little bit of IT help desk work.

I currently do not have any prior knowledge of computer languages or frameworks but I'm finding it fun to learn in my software development course. Knowledge of technologies I have are of Windows environments and some Windows Active directory as well as PC hardware.

I do not have any experience with open-source projects in the past but I am willing to learn and contribute to one.
