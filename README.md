# Spencer-Portfolio


My name is Spencer Croll and I'm currently attending Ivy Tech for a TC in IT Support. I like to watch movies, read, hangout with my girlfriend, spend time in nature, and play video games. My future career goal is to work in the Networking side of Information Technology, it's a field I'm incredibly passionate about and get a lot of joy researching and working with. I currently dont't have any degrees at the moment but will change that once I begin to puruse an Associates degree at Ivy Tech after comppleting my Technical Certificate program. I have some prior professional IT knowledge from an internship with my highschool tech department, attending Muncie Area Career Center for IT Support, some hands on experience with IT Help Desk, as well as working with my own PC home projects for both hardware and software.

I currently do not have any prior knowledge of computer languages or frameworks but I'm finding it fun to learn in my software development course and am excited to say I know some Python as the year progresses. Knowledge of technologies I have are of Windows environments and some Windows Active directory as well as PC hardware.

I do not have any experience with open-source projects in the past but I am willing and excited to learn and contribute to some in the future..
